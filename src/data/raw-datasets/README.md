# Raw Data

Given that the upload of large dataset is against GitHub best practices, we shall merely upload our *cleaned* datasets in this repository, and leave the *raw* datasets in their original locations.

The table below lists the datasets chosen for our project, their location, and the people to which each dataset is assigned.

## Chosen Datasets



Please note that every addition/modification of the chosen data pool will have to be discussed with the task leaders.
