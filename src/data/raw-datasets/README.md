# Raw Data

Given that the upload of large dataset is against GitHub best practices, we shall merely upload our *cleaned* datasets in this repository, and leave the *raw* datasets in their original locations.

The table below lists the datasets chosen for our project, their location, and the people to which each dataset is assigned.

## Chosen Datasets

| Dataset | Dataset Name | Link | Assigned to |

|2|         |         |         |
|3|         |         |         |
|4|         |         |         |
|5|         |         |         |
|6|         |         |         |
|7|         |         |         |

|12|        |         |         |
