### The Data was taken From the row 5 of the Chosen Datasets https://github.com/Vicomtech/hate-speech-dataset 
The data contained in repo was about 10,000 txt files with single sentences contained in each file and an `annotated_metadata.csv` file which contains the file Id of the 
10,000 txt files and there label (`hate`,`noHate`)
so we created a new `CSV` file containing the sentences from the text files and labels from the annotated_metadata 
and then preprocess the dataset in Desired format
### The dataset contains 
### 9507 rows of `Label` 0 (no-risk)
### 1196 rows of `Label` 2 (risky)
