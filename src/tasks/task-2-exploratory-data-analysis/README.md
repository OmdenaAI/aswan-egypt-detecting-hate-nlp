# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Task Details

In this task, we will extract useful insights from our clean datasets, based on guidelines outlined by the task leaders (these can be found in the `task2-EDA-guidelines.ipynb` notebook within this directory).

We would link to ask all collaborators to send in their work by Thursday (week 2).

## Task Goals

The goal of the task is two-fold:

- to correct any pre-processing problem that might be observed in the clean dataset and produce a final product;
- to extract insights from our data, which will be used to plan the following tasks.
