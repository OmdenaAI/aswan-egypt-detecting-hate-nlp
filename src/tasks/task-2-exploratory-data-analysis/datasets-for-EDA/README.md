# Datasets for EDA

There are numerous datasets for EDA. If you're a beginner, work on only one dataset (they are in the folder dedicated to clean data). If you're an expert programmer, feel free to work on the integrated file (contact Caterina Bonan so she can share it with you).

Please correct any pre-processing problem that might arise from EDA.
