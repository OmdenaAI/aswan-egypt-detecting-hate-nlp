# Summary
        We have provided the guidelines for the pre-processing of the datasets. We made the folders for the raw-datasets and the clean-datasets and then we processed many datasets according to the guidelines provided by the task leader and co-leader. Then, we placed all the files in the clean datasets folder and provided a brief glimpse of the pre-processed dataset in the aswan-task1.ipynb.
        The numerical analysis of the pre-processed datasets like the number of rows or the sentences, etc. is provided below for reference.
