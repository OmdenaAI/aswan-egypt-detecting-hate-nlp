# Overview of data pre-processed in task 1, and collaborators

Please refer to file `aswan-task1.ipynb` for the overview of the datasets.

The summary of the task1 is provided below for references.

# Summary:-
        We have provided the guidelines for the pre-processing of the datasets. We made the folders for the raw-datasets and the clean-datasets and then we processed many datasets according to the guidelines provided by the task leader and co-leader. Then, we placed all the files in the clean datasets folder and provided a brief glimpse of the pre-processed dataset in the aswan-task1.ipynb.
        The numerical analysis of the pre-processed datasets like the number of rows or the sentences, etc. is provided below for reference.

- Hate speech dataset ( 31,962 sentences )

- Toxic comment classification challenge ( 223,549 sentences )

- Measuring Hate Speech, Hate Speech Offensive, Twitter Tweets Sentiment ( 64,598 sentences )
